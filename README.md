# Chattest-client-win10
This app is a client for https://github.com/Rimpampa/Chattest-rs, and because of this, it focuses more on usability and additional functionality that the original version.

## Remarks
Please note that this program is only a client and cannot host a session. If you want the ability to host, you need to use Chattest-rs. This app is not being mantained by the original developer of Chattest-rs.

## Compatibility
Before connecting to a room check that the client version you are using is compatible to that of the server.
The binaries are only available for x64 and are guaranteed to work only for **Windows 10**. Other Windows versions have not been tested.

## Future Plans
The first thing I plan to do is add a gui version! In the mean time I will encorauge the developer of Chattest-rs to implement encryption.
